               When a defector named Finn (John Boyega) crash-lands on a desert planet, he meets Rey (Daisy Ridley), a tough scavenger whose droid contains
               a top-secret map. Together, the young duo joins forces with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to make sure the Resistance receives the intelligence
               concerning the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last of the Jedi Knights.</p>

              he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. He is summoned from his life as an unwanted
              child to become a student at Hogwarts, an English boarding school for wizards. There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies

            <h4>Pacific Rim</h4>
            <p>Long ago, legions of monstrous creatures called Kaiju arose from the sea, bringing with them all-consuming war. To fight the Kaiju,
              mankind developed giant robots called Jaegers, designed to be piloted by two humans locked together in a neural bridge. However, even
              the Jaegers are not enough to defeat the Kaiju, and humanity is on the verge of defeat. Mankind's last hope now lies with a washed-up
              ex-pilot (Charlie Hunnam), an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) and an old, obsolete Jaeger.</p>
